# Underwater-Trash-Detection using yolov8 model

you can run this project on your local device or in colab
 but you need first to:

- If you want to use the same data set, unzip the Marine-Trash-Detection-1 folder 
and comment on the code cell after the "Upload the data set from roboflow" comment
but if you have your custom data you have to be sure your data are in the same format 
(3 folder train, test, and val each image with a text file label, and data.yaml file)
the description of how to prepare your custom data is in the "Underwater Trash Detection | yolov8 model.ipynb" file 
under Preparing our custom dataset(marine dataset) title

- At "Underwater Trash Detection | yolov8 model.ipynb" change the value of "HOME" variable into your own path
